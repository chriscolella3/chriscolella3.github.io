                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Original Idea</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            Originally, I wanted to make an idle game. But got stuck trying make my idea unique. 
                            I started searching the Google Play store for ideas and to see what games already existed.
                            After not benefitting from my search, I started to consider what other genres of games that I enjoyed.
                            Similar to my love for idle games, I also enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_hell" target="_blank">bullet hell games</a>.
                            In short, a Bullet hell game consists of an extremely  large amount of projectiles being fired at the player. 
                            The player then has to dodge these projectiles without getting hit.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            Remembering this game genre , I immediately thought about combining it with my game idea. An idle bullet hell. 
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">No Idea What I'm Doing</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            Now that I have somewhat of an idea, and some experience using Godot, its time to begin the development.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            Starting a new project was incredibly daunting and I wasn't sure what to start with first.
                            I knew I had to start somewhere, so I decided to start small. 
                            I need to have a clear goal in mind so I don't overwhelm myself.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            The first feature I wanted to tackle was player movement. 
                            Using knowledge from the Dodge The Creeps tutorial, I was able to get movement working pretty fast.
                            I also figured out how to add a background to the game as well.
                            I do have to note, I am using WASD to move the player. 
                            This initially was for testing, as the final game would have a joystick for movement.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            The next feature I wanted to implement was projectiles firing from the player. 
                            Implementing this feature took some time as I tried to find a suitable tutorial to learn from.
                            Eventually, I found a simple projectile tutorial and added it to my player.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="column">
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/gif/player.gif" style="width:105%" height="400">
                            </div>
                              <div class="column">
                                <img src="assets/img/Stock/godotstock14.png" style="width:300%">
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            The function on line 5 is responsible for moving the projectile.
                            It is one of the many built-in functions in Godot.
                            It runs 60 times a second.
                            Using this function, I was able to constantly set the position of a projectile along the Y-axis.
                            Giving it the illusion of being fired.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            The function on line 8 is responsible for deleting the projectile when it's safely offscreen. 
                            It's connected to a VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D Node that emits a signal when whatever it's attached to goes offscreen.
                            This is to save resources and to avoid unnecessary entity overflow.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Unforeseen Changes</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                            Feeling pretty good about my progress, I decided to check out the Google Play store again for ideas.
                            It was at this time that I would stumble upon a game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.lonetower&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Lone Tower</a>.
                            Upon seeing this game, I was hooked. The idea was so simple, yet it was fun to play.
                            Without even second-guessing it, I knew what kind of game I was going to be making instead.
                        </p>
